            <h2>Spacecraft or Space Station:</h2>
       <ol class="local">
        
        <li>
            Astronauts would reside in a sophisticated spacecraft or a space station, equipped with all necessary life-support systems, including oxygen, water recycling, food supplies, and waste management.
        </li>
        <li>
            Artificial gravity might be generated through rotational sections to mimic Earth's gravity, reducing the negative effects of prolonged weightlessness.

        <h2>Challenges : </h2>
        <ol class="local">
            <h3>Isolation and Mental Health:</h3>
            <li>Prolonged isolation from Earth and loved ones could lead to significant mental health challenges. Regular virtual communication and psychological support would be crucial.</li>
            <li>A small crew living in close quarters could lead to interpersonal conflicts, requiring strong team dynamics and conflict resolution skills.</li>

            <h4> <span class="blod">Microgravity:</span> Living in microgravity affects everything from daily tasks to bodily functions. Astronauts float instead of walk, which requires learning new ways to move and work.</h4>
            <h4> <span class="blod">Daily Routine:</span> Astronauts follow a strict schedule, including work, exercise, and rest. They perform scientific research, maintain the station, and communicate with mission control.</h4>           
            <h4> <span class="blod">Exercise:</span> To counteract muscle and bone loss due to microgravity, astronauts exercise for about two hours each day using specialized equipment like treadmills and resistance machines.</h4>
            <h4> <span class="blod">Meals:</span> Food is pre-packaged and often dehydrated. It must be rehydrated and heated before eating. Special attention is given to nutrition to ensure astronauts stay healthy.</h4>
            <h4> <span class="blod">Hygiene:</span> Without running water, astronauts use rinseless wipes, no-rinse shampoo, and waterless toothpaste. They also have specially designed toilets that use airflow to manage waste.</h4>
            <h4> <span class="blod">Sleeping:</span>Astronauts sleep in small, individual quarters with sleeping bags strapped to the wall to prevent floating around.
